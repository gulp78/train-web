    <h1>The Bus</h1>
    <p>
        During the Great Depression, Clapp the commisioner of the railways at the time, saw the invention of the self-propelled
        buses being a huge success in many countries, so made branch off Victorian Railways, offering buses, killing a rival
        taxi company that was growing between Ballarat and Geelong in the process.
    </p>
    <h1>It became a train</h1>
    <p>
        Money was scarce during the Great Depression, making the railways more expensive than ever to run and mostly being
        left to rot with aging rollingstock, but with the success of the buses Clapp had ordered, he saw an opportunity arise;
        a few years prior the Mckeen Railmotor was made and was meant to be a self-propelled train, but failed due to
        unreliability, but these buses had come a long way since then.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clapp bought out and modified a few buses to be able to run on rails, they turned out to be a success, so the AEC
        Railmotor was born, being put onto branch lines to keep them open and reliable for people who didn't have enough
        money to move to somewhere with public transport.
    </p>
    <h1>The Design</h1>
    <p>
        Originally, due to glass being very expensive, the AEC Railmotor's were fitted with only blinds to keep the cold out;
        but once the Great Depression was over glass windows where fitted onto the Railmotors, and were seen on many
        smaller railway lines like the Outer Circle Railway and Fawkner Line.
