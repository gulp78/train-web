    <h1>The Railmotor</h1>
    <p>
        The First self-propelled Railmotor to be in Australia, made in America; Victorian Railways chose to trial these
        due to being far easier to maintain as well as easier to drive, without having to manually shovel coal into any
        firebox.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Mckeen Railmotor ran for a short period of time, due to being unreliable, being de-engined in 1919 and used
        as carriages instead on the Altona line until 1926.
    </p>
    <h1>The American Variants</h1>
    <p>
        While the Mckeen Railmotor's were a failure in Victoria, Australia, they were less of a failure in their
        homeland of
        America, with them surviving up into the 1930's and living on long enough to be fully restored and working into
        the modern day
