    <h1>General Info</h1>
    <p>The X'trapolis 100 was Connex's answer to replacing the aging fleet of the Hitachi train, being compaitable with
        the whole network not requiring any modifications to stations and being made far quicker than the nexas, these
        have become the backbone of the fleet today.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        The X'trapolis 100 introduced a spring-loaded bogie, which made the X'trapolis rather uncomfortable for
        passengers,
        with passengers often complaining about falling over due to the excessive bouncing. The spring-loaded bogies
        have
        also limited the X'trapolis to operating speeds between 80kmh and 100kmh, even though their motors are made to
        go a lot faster.
