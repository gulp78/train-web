    <h1>general info</h1>
    <p>The Comeng, originally ordered to replace the aging backbone of the fleet, the Tait trains which had been in
        service for 71 years (9 of which was behind a steam locomotive), were being released on the daily between 1981
        and 1988</p>
    <h1>Replacing the Harris</h1>
    <p>With the refurbishment of the Harris Series 2 being a failure, more Comeng's were ordered to replace these
        trains,
        but at the same time, the Harris's were found to be covered with Asbestos making the whole fleet needing to be
        pulled
        out of service and scrapped, which in turn made the Comeng's replace both the Tait and the Harris fleets.
    </p>
    <h1>Refurbishments:</h1>
    Between 2000 and 2003, both M>Train and Connex chose to refurbish their Comeng fleets, both based on The Met
    refurbishment concept
    <h2>The Met concept</h2>
    <p>The Met before privatisation kicked in were in middle of planning a refurbishment concept for the Comeng's
        introducing windows at the end of carriages for extra light and visibility, and a rounded front.

    <h2>M>Train</h2>
    <p>M>Train chose to go with Downer Edi Rail for their refurbishment programs,
        putting the Passenger Info screens in the middle of cars, removing the carpetted floors,
        and including the car-end windows from The Met concept.
        <br/>
        Unlike The Met Concept M>Train chose to go with a more flatter front for their refurbishment,
        making their Comeng still look similar to the original design.
        <br/>
        Downer included a yellow pole colouring on the inside to
        differentiate their refurbishment from Alstom's.

    <h2>Connex</h2>
    <p>
        Connex chose to go with Alstom for their Comeng refurbishment, and basically made their refurbishment a lot like
        The Met concept, with the rounded front and car-end windows.
        <br/>Alstom also removed the carpetted floors and made their Passenger Info Screens be at each end of the car.
        <br/>Alstom made their pole colour a light-green as a way to match Connex's interior style.
