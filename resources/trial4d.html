    <h1>general info</h1>
    <p>Ordered as a way to see if double deckers belonged on the Melbourne Network, the 4D was less than desirable,
        they had many electrical problems, making the comeng's haul them majority of the time.
    </p>
    <h1>Electrical Problems</h1>
    <p>
        During the time the 4D's were running about, sometimes the Electric brake would get stuck being applied,
        which the driver would need to call a Comeng (which had similar technology built into it), to come, hook up and
        manually release the 4D brake from the Comeng.
    </p>

        It was also said that if someone dropped their drink on the floor, it could crawl its way into the electrics, shortening 
        the whole train to a halt.
    </p>
    <h1>Retirement</h1>
    <p>
        When the 4D retired in 2002, it sat in a yard with parts slowly being pulled out to be used on Sydney's Tangara sets,
        until Sydney Trains chose to just buy the whole set, and ship it to Sydney to be pulled apart there in 2006.
