    <h1>The war between rivals</h1>
    <p>
        While there was both Connex and M>Train around, due to being rival companies, always wanted to outdo each other,
        the Comeng refurbishment was a failure due to the refurbishments being overall very similar, so when it came time to
        replace the aging fleet of the Hitachi's, M>Train chose to buy a Modular Metro from Siemens. 
        <br/>The Modular Metro M>Train chose was the Nexas, boasting wider plug doors (doors that close like a plug), 
        a wider hallway, 2x2 seating and articulated gangways, this train was made very much ahead of its time and 
        was due to outdo Connex's X'trapolis.
    </p>
    <h1>The fallback</h1>
    <p>
        When the first Nexas arrived M>Train found it was a little bit too long for their shortened platforms, so had to invest in 
        getting the platforms to be a little bit longer to fit their new large trains.
        <br/>While M>Train were able to finish this project, they never got to see their Nexas enter passenger service due to
        National Express (The company who owned M>Train) calling for bankrupcy and pulling out.
    </p>
    <h1>The Connex days</h1>
    <p>
        Connex got handed the Melbourne network franchise, and all of M>Train's assets, including the Nexas, Connex
        managed to get the nexas out onto the network in passenger services, and had a bid of which train would become
        the backbone of the fleet, the Nexas unfortunately were unable to be built fast enough so only a handful of new ones
        were built for the south-east lines and then ended the production of Nexas's.
    </p>
    <h1>Can't stop me now!</h1>
    <p>
        after a few months of the Nexas running in passenger services, there was a lot of recorded instances of the nexas's
        over-shooting platforms, and even some Nexas's that were in stabling yards, running by themselves and crashing
        into infrastructure.
