    <h1>The Railmotor</h1>
    <p>
        Introduced in 1925, after the success of the AEC Railmotor, Victorian Railways bought these as they were both
        more powerful and more comfortable than the AEC
        Railmotor.
        <br />Mostly running on short-haul journey's these were only short lived, being taken out of service in 1954
        after a service from Geelong jumped the
        tracks and crashed into a telegraph pole.
