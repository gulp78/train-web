    <h1>general info</h1>
    <p>The Harris Series 2 was a slight redesign of the Harris, including features like a gangway between carriages and
        a window for the guard to look out of</p>
    <h1>Upgrade to Series 2</h1>
    <p>
        Once the original order of the first fleet of Harris's was completed, Victorian Railways were looking to make
        more
        Harris's but also wanted to both include new features as well as remove anything that wasn't neccesary.
        <br />Series 2 Motors were far weaker than the Series 1 due to the network consisting of mostly 80kmh speed
        limits,
        but some of the new features this series did include were:
    <ul>
        <li>Guard-Side window so if the train starting rolling backwards, the guard could apply the handbrake as well as
            trainers could see how the drivers were driving</li>
        <li>Car-End Gangway so passengers could go between carriages rather than running out then back in</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Special Occasions</h1>
    <p>
        The Harris Series 2 got to do quite a few special runs during its life:
        <ul>
            <li>First Train to Belgrave</li>
            <li>The royal 10-car train</li>
            <li>Stony Point line tour</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
