    <h1>The Harris Refurbishment</h1>
    <p>
        After the success of the Comeng's introduction, The Met chose it would refurbish their Harris Series 2 to look like the
        Comeng with these changes:
        <ul>
            <li>Cab redesign to look like a Comeng</li>
            <li>Fabric half-back seats</li>
            <li>Carpetted floors</li>
            <li>Motorised doors</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>The Train that became a ghost</h1>
    <p>
        when the refurbished trains made it to the network, it was found with the weakend Series 2 motors, it struggled
        climbing hills, so the refurbishment was cancelled, and the ones which were refurbished were limited to the
        Sandringham, Port Melbourne and St Kilda lines.
