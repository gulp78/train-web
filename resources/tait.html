    <h1>Original Design</h1>
    <p>
        The Tait Train was originally proposed by Thomas James Tait as a new design which would include
        sliding doors that passengers could operate themselves rather than swing-doors which required a lot of
        porters to be stationed at stations to close them before departure, and due to the sliding doors would
        also mean more interior space for seating and people to fit into.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it came time to actually build the Tait’s they were made as carriages to be hauled by DDE steam
        locomotives which could at a later date be converted to Electric Multiple Units, due to growing demand
        for electrification of the early 19 hundreds.
    </p>
    <h1>Electrification</h1>
    <p>
        Near the end of World War 1, the trial for Electrification was underway, with electrification of the showgrounds
        line being made; The Tait Train’s were converted to their electric proposal and tested on the showgrounds line
        on 6 October 1918, marking the first electric train in Australia and the start of electrification of Melbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the success of the trial on Showgrounds line in 1918, the line between Essendon and Sandringham was
        underway with electrification, which was completed in May 1919, with the inauguration of the line happening
        within the same month, running the first daily electric commuter services.
    </p>
    <h1>The Anniversary of electrification</h1>
    <p>
        100 years after Electrification of Essendon-Sandringham, Train enthusiast took it upon themselves to celebrate
        the occasion, by putting a replica Tait Train model up at Essendon Station for the whole day, and re-creating
        the first journey by going from Essendon to Sandringham via Train, but there were Metro Tunnel works being
        undertaken between South Yarra and Elsternwick making part of their journey be done on train replacement buses.
    </p>
    <h2>Elecrail</h2>
    <p>
        The Steamrail electric branch Elecrail were given funding in 2017 to bring the Tait back into service under its
        own power, unfortunately the works needed for accreditation were more than they anticipated, but they were
        hoping
        to get an exception to make it to the Anniversary of electrification but to no avail, they then promised that
        once
        the Tait was fully accredited they would do something to mark the momentus occasion, but due to the COVID-19
        pandemic, it is going to be long time until they will be able to do anything for it.
