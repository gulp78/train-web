    <h1>Original Design/Series 1</h1>
    <p>
        Originally the Hitachi was planned to be made as a Series 3 Harris, but when the original design by Hitachi
        arrived to
        Commonwealth Engineering and Martin & King, they chose it would be best to make it, its own train, origianlly
        naming
        it the Silver Rattler (to match the Tait being Red Rattler and Harris being Blue Rattler).
        <br />The Train later became known as the Hitachi as to give homage to the original Designer Hitachi.
    </p>
    <h1>Series 1</h1>
    <p>
        Series 1 of the Hitachi, included a 4-car set and a 2-car set, some of which were converted to the 6-Car sets
        which ran
        as the standard on the Network for years to come.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Series 1 was odd looking compared to the other trains on the network at the time, carrying about a gangway
        on
        the front of the train and an interior with a more metro-esk seat layout.
        <br />The interior design of the Hitachi was made to match the new conversion of the Melbourne network to
        a Metro system
    </p>
    <h1>Refurbishments</h1>
    <h2>Series 1 Passenger-Driver door</h2>
    <p>
        During the series 1 lifetime, the front gangway was used very little due to it only being accessible to the
        driver and guard, so they made a prototype which included a door between the passenger compartment and
        the driver/guard compartment, which would be open on the middle carriages.
    </p>
    <h2>Series 2</h2>
    <p>
        After the success of the Series 1 Hitachi's it was chosen that just like the Harris they would improve upon the
        Hitachi's
        fallbacks, so the Series 2 removed the front the gangways due to the drivers complaining about the racket it
        made
        when at speed and with this removal didn't add the cab door between the passenger compartment and the
        driver comparment, as it would be pointless.
    </p>
    <h2>Metro Prototype</h2>
    <p>
        When Connex had to bring back the Hitachi's due to the the Nexas's being pulled out of service because of brake
        issues, Connex chose that alongside bringing them back they would get a refurbishment, so they made a new
        livery, new seat fabrics and played with the idea of bringing back the carpet

    </p>
    <h2>Alstom</h2>
    <p>
        During the time Connex were playing with their Prototype refurbishment, Alstom came in and offered a cheaper
        solution, that they do it instead.
        <br/>Connex agreed to let Alstom do the refurbishment, so Alstom gave the Hitachi's a new floor and seat fabric
        that matched their X'trapolis trains, and painted the handlebars green.
