    <h1>2019 concept</h1>
    <p>
        With the Comeng fleet starting to show their age, Transport for Victoria got Alstom to make concept designs for
        the Comeng replacements
        with these new trains being known as the X'trapolis 2.0, Alstom were quick to come out with designs, but TfV
        didn't create new contract
        for Alstom to continue operation risking a lot of lost jobs.

    <h1>2021 plan</h1>
    <p>
        With the new Victorian budget 2021-2022 it was revealed that the State Government were putting aside almost $1
        billion for a budget boost
        to the public transport network, one of the projects was 25 new X'trapolis 2.0 with a slightly modified version
        of the original concept for
        the trains which are set to start running by the ETA 2024.
